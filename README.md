# Azure-ETL-Pipeline-Project
This project demonstrates an ETL pipeline built using Microsoft Azure services, including Azure Data Factory, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Databricks, and an Azure Virtual Machine with SQL Server. It extracts data from Azure Blob Storage, transforms it using Databricks, and loads it into a SQL database hosted on an Azure VM.
